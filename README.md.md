# 🎤 Human Scream Detection

This project detects and classifies human scream audio using deep learning and machine learning models. It works with three classes:

- 🔴 Dangerous Scream  
- 🟡 Normal Conversation  
- 🟢 Happy Scream  

The model uses MFCC features extracted from audio and is trained on a custom dataset with CNN and LSTM architectures.
